    <center>   <h2>Most Popular Java Interview Questions</h2><br></center>
        <p>Given below is a comprehensive list of most important and commonly asked basic and advanced Java programming interview questions with detailed answers.</p><br>
<p>
    <span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;"> Q #1) What is JAVA?</span><br>

Ans: Java is a high-level programming language and is platform independent.

Java is a collection of objects. It was developed by Sun Microsystems. There are a lot of applications, websites and Games that are developed using Java.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #2) What are the features in JAVA?</span><br>

Ans: Features of Java:

Oops concepts
Object-oriented
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Platform independent: A single program works on different platforms without any modification.
High Performance: JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution.
Multi-threaded: A flow of execution is known as a Thread. JVM creates a thread which is called main thread. The user can create multiple threads by extending the thread class or by implementing Runnable interface.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #3) How does Java enable high performance?</span><br>

Ans: Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. JIT is used to convert the instructions into bytecodes.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #4) What are the Java IDE’s?</span><br>

Ans: Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE’s of JAVA.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #5) What do you mean by Constructor?</span><br>

Ans: The points given below explain what a Constructor is in detail:

When a new object is created in a program a constructor gets invoked corresponding to the class.
The constructor is a method which has the same name as class name.
If a user doesn’t create a constructor implicitly a default constructor will be created.
The constructor can be overloaded.
If the user created a constructor with a parameter then he should create another constructor explicitly without a parameter.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #6) What is meant by Local variable and Instance variable?</span><br>

Ans: Local variables are defined in the method and scope of the variables that have existed inside the method itself.

An instance variable is defined inside the class and outside the method and scope of the variables exist throughout the class.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:orangered; font-size: 15px;">Q #7) What is a Class?</span><br>

Ans: All Java codes are defined in a class. A Class has variables and methods.

Variables are attributes which define the state of a class.

Methods are the place where the exact business logic has to be done. It contains a set of statements (or) instructions to satisfy the particular requirement.
